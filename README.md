This extractor allows assigning animations from the game's _mot and _mdvl files to rigs extracted from Nier Replicant via the Kaine/Emil tools. It supports 99% of animations, though a quaternion representation issue may occasionally occur and require fixing. It partially supports parsing MDVL bones, but manual calibration via a HEX editor is recommended. 99% of animations are valid and match their in-game appearance.


I would like to express my immense gratitude to WoefulWolf and I hope he continues to develop the addon further despite the misunderstanding that occurred. Yes, yes. You still haven't extracted those animations ;)
